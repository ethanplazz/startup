      <h2>Where You Can Go</h2>
      <p>The Middle Provo River, stretching between Jordanelle Dam and Deer Creek Reservoir, is one of Utah’s most famous blue-ribbon trout fisheries and offers abundant public access along its banks. Popular entry points include Legacy Bridge near the Jordanelle tailwater, which provides year-round cold flows ideal for rainbow and brown trout, and the River Road Trail area, where miles of accessible river wind through scenic farmland and meadows. Other excellent spots include Bunny Farm, Charleston Bridge, and the Midway Lane access points, all known for consistent hatches and productive fly-fishing. The LDS Church fields access and several pull-offs along River Road also allow anglers to spread out and find less pressured water. With consistent flows, diverse insect life, and healthy fish populations, the Middle Provo is considered the crown jewel of the river system, though it can become busy, especially during peak hatch seasons.</p>

      <h2>Regulations</h2>
      <p>The Provo River is managed as a blue-ribbon fishery, and anglers should be aware of special regulations that vary by section. Throughout much of the river—especially the popular Middle Provo and Lower Provo stretches—artificial flies and lures only are allowed, which means bait fishing is prohibited. There are also size and harvest limits in place to protect the trout populations: typically, only a small number of trout may be kept, and many stretches are catch-and-release for certain species, especially brown and rainbow trout. The Upper Provo, by contrast, has more general regulations and allows bait in some areas, though limits still apply. Statewide rules, such as requiring a valid Utah fishing license and following daily bag limits, apply to all sections. Because regulations can change from year to year, anglers should always check the latest Utah Division of Wildlife Resources (UDWR) fishing guidebook before heading out to ensure they’re in compliance.</p>
